# URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener project built with a LAMP stack. The project aims to provide a practical way to improve my backend development skills while learning about self-hosting a LAMP server. The URL shortener allows users to shorten long URLs and retrieve them later by entering the corresponding short code.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:
- **Enhance Backend Development Skills**: Focus on building and managing a backend system using PHP and MySQL.
- **Learn Self-Hosting on LAMP**: Gain hands-on experience with LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to host a dynamic web application on a local server.
  
This will be a private repository, and the project is intended to be self-hosted for personal use and learning purposes.

## Features

- **Generate Short URLs**: Convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.
- **Redirect to Original URL**: When a user clicks a short URL, they will be redirected to the original URL.
- **Database Management**: All URLs are stored in a MySQL database, making it easy to manage and retrieve short URLs.
- **Simple UI**: A basic web interface to enter and generate short URLs.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML for user input
- **Backend**: PHP for handling URL shortening logic
- **Database**: MySQL for storing original and shortened URLs
- **Hosting**: LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

## Ftuture Improvements

- **URL Expiration**: Allows users to set an expiration date for the shortened URL.
- **User Authentication**: Add authentication so users can view/manage their shortened URLs.
- **Custom Aliases**: Allow users to define custom short codes.
- **Analytics**: Track and display the number of times a short URL is accessed.
